# Coursework-Semester-1

These are individual courseworks during my graduate study. 

The aim of sharing is to summarise my own work and give anyone any inspiration. If it is really helpful or you like it, please give me a star to let me know;-)

Course  content:

## 1. INF6027 Introduction to Data Science
Coursework: [Analysis of UK police Dataset report](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Introduction_to_Data_Science.pdf)=============>**Distinction (nearly;-)**

## 2. INF6029 Data Analysis

Coursework: [Contribution of individual factors to happiness](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Data_Analysis.pdf)=======================>

The title of the individual coursework is "to use SPSS software to analyse The Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing (NLSAA) dataset which aims to investigate the elder physical or psychological wellbeing". The author, therefore, selects happiness as the dependent variable and five potential individual factors: gender, age, health, class and relationship with children. In addition, the descriptive statistic and inferential statistic method, including the Chi-squared test and logistic regression, is used to determine the effect of these variables on happiness. It is argued that gender, age and health can influence the level of happiness.

## 3. INF6033 Data and Society

Coursework: [Challenges in the interaction between data and society](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Data_and_Society.pdf)=====================>**Distinction**

The main content of this essay is to investigate the challenge to data science practice from three aspects: Social-political power, Bias and Ethic issue. It is argued that unbalanced power is a major factor for non-neutral data science practice which reflects the bias in society. Based on this, the author provides and analyses potential solutions such as GDPR.

## 4. INF6060 Information Retrieval and Search Engine
Courseworks: [The YouTube website search system evalution report](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Information_Retrieval.pdf)====>**Distinction**

In this report, the author selects the YouTube website to test but only assesses its search system, rather than other tasks such as sharing or downloading videos. There are three main aspects the author will investigate: functionalities, effectiveness and usability. In addition, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is used to examine Precision and Relevance rank individually. It is argued that the YouTube website search system can complete most common users' tasks effectively, but further work is needed to meet expert users' need.

## 5. INF6903 Academic Writing
Coursework: [Contribution of data science on society](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Academic_Writing.pdf)====================>**Distinction**

**Important statement: the essays and reports cannot be paraphrased in your academic writing (including reference and citation). Because these materials are not peer-reviewed articles. Be sensible and don't copy or Turnitin will tell!!**
