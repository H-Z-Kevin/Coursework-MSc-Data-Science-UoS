Coursework: [Contribution of individual factors to happiness](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Data_Analysis.pdf)=======================>

The title of the individual coursework is "to use SPSS software to analyse The Nottingham Longitudinal Study of Activity and Ageing (NLSAA) dataset which aims to investigate the elder physical or psychological wellbeing". 

**In this report, the author selects happiness as the dependent variable and five potential individual factors: gender, age, health, class and relationship with children. In addition, the descriptive statistic and inferential statistic method, including the Chi-squared test and logistic regression, is used to determine the effect of these variables on happiness. It is argued that gender, age and health can influence the level of happiness.**

Coursework: [Challenges in the interaction between data and society](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Data_and_Society.pdf)=====================>**Distinction**

Here is the original title of essay from lecturer:

"Using key sociological concepts and illustrating your argument with one or more examples of real data science practice involving data about people, discuss some of the challenges you may experience as a data scientist when trying to create actionable knowledge using data science techniques in ethically and legally appropriate ways."

**According to this, the main content of this essay is to investigate the challenge to data science practice from three aspects: Social-political power, Bias and Ethic issue. It is argued that unbalanced power is a major factor for non-neutral data science practice which reflects the bias in society. Based on this, the author provides and analyses potential solutions such as GDPR.**
