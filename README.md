coursework: [Contribution of individual factors to happiness](https://github.com/H-Z-Kevin/Coursework-Semester-1/blob/master/Coursework-Final-Version/Data_Analysis.pdf)

In this report, the author selects happiness as the dependent variable and five potential individual factors: gender, age, health, class and relationship with children. In addition, the descriptive statistic and inferential statistic method, including the Chi-squared test and logistic regression, is used to determine the effect of these variables on happiness. It is argued that gender, age and health can influence the level of happiness.
